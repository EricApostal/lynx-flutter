# Lynx for Flutter
Run Lynx apps in Flutter!

## Getting Started
- **Warning**: This is in heavy development! **This package currently does not function to usable degree**. Contributions are welcome while we get it off the ground!

## Support
We intend on supporting Android, iOS, and Web, because that is what Lynx supports.
- ðŸŸ¨ Android
- ðŸŸ¥ Web
- ðŸŸ¥ iOS

Other platforms are technically supported via a WebView. If official support for other platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS) is added to Lynx, I will add it to this package if possible.
